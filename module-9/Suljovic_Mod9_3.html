        <p>
            Ripley lunges INTO FRAME with an animal outcry. She clutches her chest, breathing hard. Bathed in sweat she lights a cigarette with <span id = "trembling">_________</span> hands. Do we hear a faint, desolate wind?.
        </p>
        <p>
            TIGHT ON PHONE CONSOLE as Ripley's hand inserts Burke's card into a slot. "<span id = "STAND BY">_________</span>" prints out on the screen and is replaced by Burke's face, bleary with sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
            An enormous chamber, cavernous and dark. <span id = "Squatting">_________</span> in the shadows are two orbit-to-surface <span id = "shuttles">_________</span>. DROP-SHIPS.  Heavy machinery all around them... cranes, loading equipment.
